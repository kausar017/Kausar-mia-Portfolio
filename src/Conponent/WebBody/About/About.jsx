            Hello! I’m Kausar Mia, a passionate and dedicated Front-End Web
            Developer from Mymensingh, Bangladesh. I’ve completed my Diploma in
            Computer Technology, and I’m currently building my career in web
            development. I started my journey with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            and gradually developed strong skills in React, Tailwind CSS, and
            modern web frameworks.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I love creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that
            provide great user experiences. Coding isn’t just my skill—it’s
            something I truly enjoy. Every day, I spend hours improving my
            coding ability and learning new technologies to stay updated with
            the fast-moving web world.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Right now, I’m focusing on becoming a full-stack developer, and I’m
            also exploring real-world projects through my job at Softvens
            Agency. My goal is to build modern and impactful web applications
            that make people’s lives easier. I believe in continuous learning,
            teamwork, and writing code that’s simple, efficient, and elegant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new skills, listening to music,
            and exploring creative ideas that inspire me to grow as both a
            developer and a person.
